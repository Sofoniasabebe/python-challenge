# python-challenge
Analysis of a company's financial records and modernizing the vote-counting process of a rural town.  

## PyBank

In this part of the challenge, the task was to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a given company. 
A financial dataset called budget_data.csv was provided. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

A a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values was created:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

The script automated a mechanism to gain insights into the company's finances. 

## PyPoll

In this Challenge, the task was to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

A set of poll data called election_data.csv was provided for the challenge. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote

The final script allowed the automation of the process of analyzing election data by cunting votes, calculating the peercentages of votes per candidate, and determining the winner of the election. 

The script prints the results in terminal and outputs a text file as well.
